How are the ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of the ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
The histogram show the most frequency of the choco rating is between 3 and 2.5. Second most frequency is between 2.5 and 3 and third is 3.5 to 4. The forth is 2.5 to 3. The outliers approximately occur between 1 to 2 and 4 to 5 from the box plot.
```{r cars}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
choco_rating<-choco$Rating
hist(choco_rating)
boxplot(choco_rating)
```

Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar?
I create a plot with rating for x axis and cacoa percentage for y axis. From the plot, we can see the rating does not depend on the cacao percentage of chocolate bar. The higher rating does not change the cacao percentage
```{r}
plot(x=choco_rating,y=choco$Cocoa.Pct)
```
